  <h1>ModDB</h1>
  <p>
    A database for many mod-related things. Planned:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A modid to loader and download sources mapper
    </li>
    <li>
      A mod name to modid, loader, sources mapper
    </li>
    <li>
      A mixin database
    </li>
    <li>
      A mod compability database (This might also use other sources)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Additionally, I plan to provide services using this API, but also using other sources
